## Intent Objects, Intent Filters, Linking the Activities Using Intent, Obtaining Results from Intent, Passing Data Using an Intent Object 

Intents are used for communication between components in an Android application. Here's a brief explanation of Intent objects, Intent filters, linking activities using Intent, obtaining results from Intent, and passing data using an Intent object.

1. Intent Objects:
An Intent object is a messaging object used to request an action from another component of the same or different application. It is used to start a new activity, service or to deliver a broadcast message.

Example of starting a new activity using an Intent object:

```
Intent intent = new Intent(this, NewActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);
```

In the above example, we created an Intent object to start a new activity called `NewActivity` and then called `startActivity()` method to start the activity.

2. Intent Filters:
Intent filters are used to declare the capabilities of a component. It is used to specify the types of intents that the component can receive.

Example of an intent filter in the manifest file:

```
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:label="@string/app_name" >
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

In the above example, we have specified an intent filter for the `MainActivity` activity to receive the `android.intent.action.MAIN` action and `android.intent.category.LAUNCHER` category.

3. Linking activities using Intent:
We can link activities using Intent object by passing data between them.

Example of passing data between activities:

```
// In Activity A
Intent intent = new Intent(this, ActivityB.class);
intent.putExtra("key", "value");
startActivity(intent);

// In Activity B
String data = getIntent().getStringExtra("key");
```

In the above example, we created an Intent object in Activity A with data and passed it to Activity B. We then retrieved the data in Activity B using `getStringExtra()` method.

4. Obtaining results from Intent:
We can obtain results from an activity using startActivityForResult() method.

Example of obtaining results from an activity:

```
// In Activity A
Intent intent = new Intent(this, ActivityB.class);
startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE);

@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    if (requestCode == REQUEST_CODE) {
        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
            String result = data.getStringExtra("result");
        }
    }
}

// In Activity B
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.putExtra("result", "Data to be returned");
setResult(RESULT_OK, intent);
finish();
```

In the above example, we started Activity B from Activity A using `startActivityForResult()` method. We then obtained the results from Activity B in Activity A using `onActivityResult()` method.

I hope this helps!
